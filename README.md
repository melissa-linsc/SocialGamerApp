This application uses data from a backend API to create a social media app for gamers. It includes features such as login authentication, real-time chat with other users, adding video games to personal libraries and viewing recommended games based on an initial selection of liked games made by a user.

To run the app:
- fork the repo from github
- in your computer's terminal cd into the directory where you would like to clone the file (e.g cd Northcoders/Project)
- in the correct directory run "git clone https://github.com/mikael-v/nc-news-fe.git" and then open the file using the editor of your choice
- in the editor's terminal run `npm install`
- on an android or ios mobile device download the expo go app
- in the editor terminal run `npx expo start` or if the device you're using the edito on and your mobile device use different WiFi connections run `npx espo start --tunnel`
- using the mobile expo go app scan the qr code generated in the terminal
- the app will now run on your mobile device
